"""Kubeconfig merger: pull cluster kubeconfig from a CP node, merge into ~/.kube/config.

Behaviour contract:
  - Reads the cluster admin kubeconfig via PveSshProxy (Ubuntu+k3s path):
        sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
    The historical `talosctl --nodes <cp> kubeconfig /admin` path is
    retained as `_talos_kubeconfig()` for completeness, but is no
    longer the default -- the live cluster runs Ubuntu+k3s, not Talos.
  - Writes the resulting KUBECONFIG to a per-cluster kubeconfig file
    (infra/clusters/<name>/kubeconfig) for repeat use. The server:
    URL is rewritten to point at the local apiserver forward so
    kubectl on the operator host hits the tunnel, not loopback.
  - Merges it into the operator's ~/.kube/config, with a timestamped
    backup of the existing ~/.kube/config before any modification.
  - All stdout from the proxy is funneled through StructuredLogger.scrub()
    so token-bearing lines never reach the log.
