"""WP05: no-new-host-ports verifier.

M2 misfit verification. SSHes to the PVE host, dumps the current nft
prerouting chain, and diffs it against a captured baseline. Any new DNAT
rule (TCP/UDP dport -> ip:port) is treated as an unauthorized host port
addition and surfaces as HostPortsAddedError -- which the
bootstrap_cluster.py harness converts into a structured BootstrapError.

The baseline file is captured once at WP00 bootstrap (via a baseline
script). On every WP05+ run we assert the diff is empty.

Output of `nft list chain ip nat prerouting` looks like:

    table ip nat {
        chain prerouting {
            type nat hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;
        }
    }

If a Cloudflare-tunnel-induced DNAT rule were silently added (e.g. via a
chart hook), it would appear inline as a `tcp dport X dnat to Y:Z` line.
We diff line-by-line against the baseline; new lines with `dnat to`
are flagged.
